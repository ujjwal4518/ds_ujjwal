## 📌 Objective

Analyze how **trader behavior** (profit, risk, volume, leverage) aligns or diverges from **market sentiment** (Fear vs Greed).  
Goal is to uncover insights that can drive smarter, sentiment-aware trading strategies in crypto.

---

## 📂 Datasets Used

1. **Bitcoin Market Sentiment Dataset**

   - Columns: `timestamp`, `value`, `classification` (Fear/Greed), `date`

2. **Historical Trader Data from Hyperliquid**
   - Columns: `Account`, `Coin`, `Size USD`, `Closed PnL`, `Leverage`, etc.

---

## 🧠 Key Insights

- **PnL increases** during Greed phases; higher loss outliers during Fear.
- **Trade sizes** (USD) increase during Greed sentiment.
- **Leverage** (where available) tends to rise with Greed.
